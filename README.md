# Blackdot Solutions Technical Test

As the brief disallowed the use of API's I chose to implement this with a screen scrape and then use HtmlAgilityPack to parse the results.

It's an asp.net MVC application which can be run by opening in VIsual Studio and running the debugger.  HtmlAgilityPack was imported with Nuget.  The web app will need to be set as the start up project.
